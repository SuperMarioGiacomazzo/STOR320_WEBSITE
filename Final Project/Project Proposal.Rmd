# **Purpose**

The purpose of the project proposal is to demonstrate your ability to find relevant and interesting data and to propose many thoughtful and creative questions about that data. This is the first stage in your final project, and the data you select will be heavily explored for the remainder of the project. Work as a team to find data that intrigues the entire team and develop questions that are valuable for exploration.

# **Requirements**
All members of the group should be involved in the selection of the data. The data should have at least 5 variables that are not identifiers and will be studied in depth. Out of all the variables, at least 2 should be categorical. If your data only contains numeric variables, your group should decide on how to treat at least two of the variables as categorical. You are able to use multiple datasets in your project, but these will need to be merged at some point. To ensure future parts of the final project go smoothly, I recommend finding a dataset that contains more than 10 variables. To ensure your group is free of plagiarism, I recommend selecting datasets that are not attached to many online analyses. 

Each member of the group is required to design at least two initial questions. These questions can be very general but should not be trivial. I recommend discussing the data as a group, design questions together, and then delegate the questions for future use. In later project parts, your group will be required to investigate these questions and then devise new follow-up questions for future analysis. Think generally about these initial questions so there is room for growth. Choose questions that have not been analyzed online for the data you have selected.

The Creator should schedule a 5 minute meeting during office hours of either the Instructor or Instructional Assistant (IA). To reserve your 5 minute time slot, email ahead of time. Time slots will be priortized according to email and posted on a google spreadsheet linked on the website. I highly recommend scheduling your project proposal as soon as possible to ensure you have a spot before the deadline. If your Creator fails to schedule the project proposal meeting before the deadline, a minimum 2 point penalty will be given. This penalty applies to your entire group.

In this meeting, the Creator should come prepared with the dataset downloaded and ready to display on a laptop. The Creator will tell the Instructor or IA where there group found the data and a summary about the variables contained in the data. The Creator should mention how many variables are of interest for future analyses, which of the variables are numerical, which of the variables are categorical or will be treated as categorical, and state all the questions your group will start to explore. The Creator should also communicate to the Instructor or IA what roles the other members of the group are taking. I will need full names and roles to update the google spreadsheets linked on the website. If your reasearch group has four members, each of the remaining 3 members should be assigned to the roles of Interpreter, Orator, and Deliverer. If your research group has five members, there should be 2 Orators responsible for the final presentation.
