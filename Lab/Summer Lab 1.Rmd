# Lab 1a: Basic Data Transformation

## Introduction

The main purpose of this tutorial is to put together 4 key functions from **[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)**. The functions and their purposes are listed as follows:

- `filter()` *Selects Observations Based on Values*

- `arrange()` *Sorts Observations Based on Criteria*

- `select()` or `rename()` *Selects, Deselects, Renames, and Reorders Variables*

- `mutate()` or `transmute()` *Creates New Variables Which Were Originally Nonexistant*

Despite my despise for the entire airline industry, we will practice our skills using the dataset `flights` by loading the R package `nycflights13`. My ultimate wish for you is that by the end of this tutorial you will have tenderly played with this dataset so much that you will also hate the airline industry. If my wish does not come true this hot session, be sure that it will by the end of this semester.

Now in the words of the late, great, **[Frank Sinatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra)**, come fly with me.-

> Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.

> -- <cite>Frank Sinatra</cite>

You will need to modify the code chunks so that the code works within each of chunk (usually this means modifying anything in ALL CAPS). You will also need to modify the code outside the code chunk. When you get the desired result for each step, change `Eval=F` to `Eval=T` and knit the document to HTML to make sure it works. Do not work out of order or skip around. After you complete the lab or by the end of class, you should submit your HTML file to Sakai.

## Part 1: The Uniqueness of Flight Numbers

### 1.1 (0.5 Points)

Using `filter()`, start by creating a new tibble called **f1a** that only contains records from flight number 807.
```{r,eval=F}
f1a<-filter(flights, CRITERIA)
```
### 1.2 (0.5 Points)

Now, apply `select()` to create a new dataset **f1b** based on **f1a** only containing variables "flight", "carrier", "origin", and "dest".
```{r,eval=F}
f1b<-select(f1a, VARIABLES)
```

### 1.3 (0.5 Points)

Rename the variable "dest" to "destination" in **f1c**.
```{r,eval=F}
f1c=rename(f1b,COMPLETE)
```

### 1.4 (0.5 Points)

Because **f1c** only contains records for flight number 807, sorting by flight number is irrelevant. Create a new dataset **f1d** that is identical in content to **f1c** but is sorted by "carrier" first, "origin" second, and "destination"" last. Use the function `head()`to display the first 5 rows of the data in **f1d**.

```{r,eval=F}
f1d<-arrange(f1c,VARIABLES)
head(COMPLETE)
```

### 1.5 (1.5 Points)

At first glance from the output above, it seems that flight number 807 uniquely represents the flight from _______ to _______ by carrier ________. (Fill in the Blanks). 

### 1.6 (0.5 Points)

To confirm this, create a new dataset **f1e** that is **f1d** sorted by the three variables previously mentioned, all in descending order. The function `desc()` is required here. Follow this by displaying the first 18 rows of the data in **f1d**.

```{r,eval=F}
f1e<-arrange(f1d,SORT_BY)
head(f1e,18)
```

### 1.7 (1 Point)

Answer the following questions using the output from the previous question:

May we conclude that flight numbers can be mapped to a unique carrier? ________ (*Yes/No*)

Why or why not?

If we know the flight number, carrier, and origin, can we know for sure what the destination will be? ________ (*Yes/No*)

Why or why not?

## Part 2: Time to Get on the Pipe

In the previous section, we created a new tibble every time we wanted to perform a modification to the data. Behold the pipe `%>%`, your path to RAM-saving, sleek code and my path to coins. The pipe `%>%` is used in a similar fashion to `+` in the `ggplot2()` package. It's time to take a magical journey through the tidyverse on the pipe.

### 2.1 (0.5 Points)

Start by using `transmute()` to create a new variable "dep_hr" based on "dep_time" which represents departure time in hours since midnight. Recall the code for this is `dep_hr=dep_time%/%100+(dep_time%%100)/60`. In the same step, do this also for "sched_dep_time","arr_time", and "sched_arr_time" naming the new variables "sched_dep_hr", "arr_hr", and "sched_arr_hr", respectively. Save all these new variables to a new tibble called **f2a**. Use the function `names()` to ensure that **f2a** only contains the new variables and the function `head()` to view the top 5 rows.

```{r, eval=F}
f2a=transmute(flights,
          dep_hr=dep_time%/%100+(dep_time%%100)/60,
          sched_dep_hr=sched_dep_time%/%100+(sched_dep_time%%100)/60,
          arr_hr=arr_time%/%100+(arr_time%%100)/60,
          sched_arr_hr=sched_arr_time%/%100+(sched_arr_time%%100)/60)
names(TIBBLE)
head(TIBBLE,5)
```

### 2.2 (0.5 Points)

Now we can create true delay variables, measured in hours, for both departure and arrival. Using `mutate()`, create a new variable "dep_delay_hr" which equals the difference between "dep_hr" and "sched_dep_hr". Analogously, perform the same operation for arrival. Call the new dataset **f2b**.

```{r,eval=F}
f2b=mutate(f2a,
           dep_delay_hr=TRANSFORMATION,
           arr_delay_hr=TRANSFORMATION)
```

### 2.3 (0.5 Points)

Next, use `mutate()` again to create a new variable called "gain_hr" which is the difference between "arr_delay_hr" and "dep_delay_hr", measured in hours. Within the same step, use the function `percent_rank()` to create a new variable "percent_gain_hr" which represents the percentiles of the previously variable you created. Notice that you can develop variables based on recently transformed variables in the same iteration of `mutate()`, but be careful little buddy because order matters. Name the new dataset **f2c**.

```{r,eval=F}
f2c=mutate(f2b,
           gain_hr=TRANSFORMATION,
           percent_gain_hr=percent_rank(gain_hr))
```


### 2.4 (0.5 Points)

First, critically think about what this new variable "gain_hr" is measuring. When `gain_hr==0`, what does that mean about the flight? What does `gain_hr<0` and `gain_hr>0` indicate. Use `filter()` to select the observations where `percent_gain_hr<0.1` or `percent_gain_hr>0.9` in a new dataset **f2d**. The tibble **f2d** will contain the bottom 10% and top 10% of flights based off "gain_hr".

```{r,eval=F}
f2d<-filter(f2c,CRITERIA)
```

### 2.5 (0.5 Points)

Finally, sort the data using `arrange()` from largest to smallest based on the variable "percent_gain_hr". Name the sorted tibble **f2e**. 
```{r,eval=F}
f2e<-arrange(f2d,VARIABLE)
```

### 2.6 (1 Points)

Getting the original data from **flights** to **f2e** required multiple steps. If we know what we want to do with the raw data from `flights`, we can use the pipe `%>%` to obtain the same result without intermittently introducing new tibbles into our global environment. Modify the code below so that the tibble named **f2e.pipedream** is identical to `f2e`.


```{r,eval=F}
f2e.pipedream = flights %>%
                transmute(COMPLETE) %>%
                mutate(COMPLETE) %>%
                mutate(COMPLETE) %>%
                filter(COMPLETE) %>%
                arrange(COMPLETE)
```

The tibble **f2e.pipedream** should identical to **f2e** in the number of observations (67,018), the number of variables (8), and the order of observations. We can check to see if the tibble **f2e** is identical to **f2e.pipedream** using `identical()`. You should see the function return `True` Can you feel the sensation? It's piping hot up in here.

```{r,eval=F}
identical(f2e,f2e.pipedream)
```

## Part 3: Measuring Accuracy

### 3.1 (0.5 Points)

How would you measure the accuracy of individual flights? We can say that a flight is accurate if it leaves on time and arrives on time. Suppose we want to create an accuracy measure that captures this information where larger values indicate more inaccurate flights. Try to think of a creative way to measure accuracy by using `mutate()` to construct a new variable named "accuracy". Call the new tibble `f.accuracy`. As a data scientist, the metric you want is not always in the raw data. This is an example of problem that requires a level of innovation for which a job will grant you some cash money.

```{r,eval=F}
f.accuracy<-mutate(flights,
                dep_hr=dep_time%/%100+(dep_time%%100)/60,
                sched_dep_hr=sched_dep_time%/%100+(sched_dep_time%%100)/60,
                arr_hr=arr_time%/%100+(arr_time%%100)/60,
                sched_arr_hr=sched_arr_time%/%100+(sched_arr_time%%100)/60,
                dep_delay_hr=dep_hr-sched_dep_hr,
                arr_delay_hr=arr_hr-sched_arr_hr,
                accuracy=TRANSFORMATION)
head(f.accuracy,5)
```

### 3.2 (1 Points)

Preparing for comparisons of airline carriers on accuracy, we use the `select()` function to create a new tibble named `f.accuracy2` which only contains the variables "carrier" and "accuracy".
```{r,eval=F}
f.accuracy2=select(f.accuracy,carrier,accuracy)
```

Next, we can evaluate carriers based on their average accuracy across all flights based on our new metric. Furthermore, the standard deviation of this accuracy metric can help us measure the consistency of these airline carriers in performance. Use the `summarize()` function combined with `group_by()` for quick aggregation on the carrier level. Calculate the average accuracy and the standard deviation of the accuracy for each carrier

```{r,eval=F}
carrier.summary<- f.accuracy2 %>%
                  group_by(COMPLETE) %>%
                  summarize(
                    mean.accuracy=mean(COMPLETE,na.rm=T),
                    sd.accuracy=sd(COMPLETE,na.rm=T)
                  )
carrier.summary
```


# Lab 1b: Advanced Data Transformation

## Introduction

The main purpose of this tutorial is to put together all 5 key functions from **[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)** and use them to create summary tables and delightful graphs in RMarkdown. The functions and their purposes are listed as follows:

- `filter()` *Selects Observations Based on Values*

- `arrange()` *Sorts Observations Based on Criteria*

- `select()` or `rename()` *Selects, Deselects, Renames, and Reorders Variables*

- `mutate()` or `transmute()` *Creates New Variables Which Were Originally Nonexistant*

- `summarize()` *Aggregates the Data Based on Helpful Summary Statistics*

To further incite your anger towards the airline industry, we will continue to practice our skills using the dataset `flights` by loading the R package `nycflights13`. Until we learn how to fly, this dataset remains relevant.

## Part 1: Summarizing the Data (4 Points)

Using the pipe `%>%` to chain functions from `dplyr`, modify the code below to create a dataset named `flight.summary` that contains the following ordered modfications:

1. Starts with the raw dataset `flights` in the package `nycflights13`.

2. Transform delay variables so that they are measured in minutes since midnight, and then create a metric to measure accuracy based on those transformed delay variables. **Use the geometric distance like seen in lecture.**

3. Remove missing observations.

4. Group data based on combinations of "origin", "dest", and "carrier".

5. Summarize the data using the number of observations, the accuracy mean, the accuracy variance, and the mean distance for each combination of "origin", "dest", and "carrier". 

6. Filters summarized data to remove all combinations of "origin", "dest", and "carrier" with less than or equal to 10 flights throughout 2013.

7. Release the grouping constraint using the function `ungroup()`.

8. Create a variable called "proportion"" that represents the proportion of flights within each combination (with more than 10 flights).

```{r, eval=F}
flight.summary = 
  
  #1
  RAWDATA %>%
          
  #2
  mutate(
    dep_min       = (dep_time%/%100)*60+dep_time%%100,
    sched_dep_min = (sched_dep_time%/%100)*60+sched_dep_time%%100,
    arr_min       = (arr_time%/%100)*60+arr_time%%100,
    sched_arr_min = (sched_arr_time%/%100)*60+sched_arr_time%%100,
    dep_delay_min = dep_min-sched_dep_min,
    arr_delay_min = arr_min-sched_arr_min,
    accuracy      = ACCURACY_FORMULA
  ) %>%
  
  #3
  filter(CRITERIA) %>%
  
  #4
  group_by(VARIABLES) %>%

  #5
  summarize(
    count=FUNCTION1,
    mean.acc=FUNCTION2,
    var.acc=FUNCTION3,
    mean.dist=FUNCTION4
  ) %>%
  
  #6
  filter(CRITERIA) %>%
  
  #7
  ungroup() %>%
  
  #8
  mutate(proportion=FORMULA)

head(flight.summary) #DO NOT CHANGE THIS LINE OF CODE
```


## Part 2: Building Charts From Summary Data

### 2.1 (1 Point)

<center><img src="graph1.png"></center>

The purpose of creating this plot was to investigate if flight accuracy gets worse or better for longer flights. The chart above displays the approximated linear relationship between flight accuracy and flight distance for each the 3 NYC airports. This first image was created using a combination of `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`. Recreate this image using `ggplot()` and remember to modify the defaults of `geom_smooth()` to get linear trend lines without standard error regions. 

```{r,eval=F}
ggplot(data=flight.summary) +
  geom_point(MORE)+
  geom_smooth(MORE)
```

### 2.2 (1 Point)

The first thing we notice is that not many flights are over 3000 miles in distance. Design a new plot similar to the one above that ignores the scenarios where the distance exceeds 3000. This will prevent rare occurrences from effecting our linear trend comparison and present these relationships in a zoomed-in window where the majority of data exists.

```{r,eval=F}
ggplot(data=filter(flight.summary,CRITERIA)) +
  geom_point(MORE)+
  geom_smooth(MORE)
```

### 2.3 (1 Point)

Answer the following question using complete sentences: 

Each trend line is doing different things. Which of the three originating airports is doing the worst regarding the relationship between flight accuracy and flight distance? Explain why.

REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ANSWER

## Part 3: Build a Nice Table to Be Displayed in RMarkdown (1 Point)

The dataset we created, `flight.summary`, summarizes the raw data but still contains 370 observations. Below I have provided code, that produces a dataset called `flight.summary2` that only contains the top 5 and bottom 5 combinations of "origin", "dest", and "carrier" based on mean accuracy. Closely examine this code and ensure that you understand what is happening here. Set `eval=T` to create `flight.summary2`. 

```{r,eval=F}
flight.summary2 = 
  flight.summary %>%
  mutate(rank=min_rank(mean.acc)) %>%
  filter(min_rank(mean.acc)<=5 | min_rank(desc(mean.acc))<=5) %>%
  arrange(rank)
```

The `kable()` function in the `knitr` package allows for creating HTML tables. For information about the `kable` package, click **[here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html)** Furthermore, the `kableExtra` package allows you to add beauty to those internet-ready tables. Click **[here](http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html)** for a helpful introduction. 

Once you understand the function of `kable()` and the modifications you can apply, start an R code chunk to place the information required to produce an HTML table of `flight.summary2`.

```{r}
#
```



## Part 4: Additional Questions (2 Points)

In this class you will be forced to analyze data you probably care very little about. *This is the part in the class where you begin to act like you care.* An important rule in this class is to "love thy data as thyself." Consider the `flights` data from both the view of the airline executive and the customer. Given what you know about the data, write two questions that you would want to answer that would influence how you buy airline tickets.

1) WRITE A QUESTION HERE THAT YOU COULD ANSWER FROM THE DATA YOU HAVE


2) WRITE A QUESTION HERE THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT GETTING THAT INFORMATION OR WHERE COULD YOU GO TO GET THAT INFORMATION
