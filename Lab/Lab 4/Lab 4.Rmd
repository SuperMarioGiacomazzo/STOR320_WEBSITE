# Instructions

**Exercises:**  2,3 (Pg. 151); 2,4 (Pg. 156); 1,2 (Pgs. 160-161); 2 (Pg. 163); 2,3,4 (Pg. 168)

**Submission:** Submit via an electronic document on Sakai. Must be submitted as a HTML file generated in RStudio. All assigned problems are chosen according to the textbook *R for Data Science*. You do not need R code to answer every question. If you answer without using R code, delete the code chunk. If the question requires R code, make sure you display R code. If the question requires a figure, make sure you display a figure. A lot of the questions can be answered in written response, but require R code and/or figures for understanding and explaining.
